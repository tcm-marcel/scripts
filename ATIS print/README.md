# ATIS print

This script is for students at the KIT[1], who have access to an ATIS[2] account[3]. It takes one or more files as argument and prints them remotely on a defined printer in the ATIS.

## Usage

The order of parameters is completely irrelevant.

    .../ATIS_print [file(s)] [-u user] [-p printer] [-n number-of-copies] [-r from to] [-c num]

- **files:** Regular expressions and files are allowed.
- **-u user:** Specify a user for printing. This will dominate the default, but not override it permanently. Like a one-time-ticket. Useful for quickly printing things for others.
- **-p printer:** Use given printer. Must be sw1, sw2, sw3 (monochrome) or farb1 (color).
- **-n number-of-copies:** Specify how many times the files should be printed. Use integers only.
- **-r from to:** Specify a page **r**ange using integers as `from` and `to`. Only pages within this range will be printed if this is used. Currently, only one range is supported. May not work with every format. If used with `-c`, only PDFs will be limited to this range.
- **-c num:** Compact / N-up print. This will print `num` pages on one page. `num` can be 2,4,6 or 9.

## Dependencies

It depends on basic applications which are default on most unix-like operating systems. Tested on Ubuntu Linux and OSX Mavericks. 

    # required dependencies
    bash, scp, ssh
    # optional dependencies
    gs  #to use -r together with -c, see usage of -r

## Contribution wishlist, ideas and bugs

- BUG: Files with same names in different directories in one atis\_print call cause problems.
- For text/code print jobs, allow to adjust the text size (like `--txt-size 8`)
- Allow to print one/two-sided (like `-nd` or `--no-duplex`, also long- or short-sided?)
- Create Install/setup scripts for easier usage (install i.e. to `~/bin/`)
- Create completion file for better terminal experience (bash, fish, ...) or/and a manpage
- User should only need to input the password one time
