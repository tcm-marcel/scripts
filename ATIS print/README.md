# ATIS print

This script is for students at the KIT[1], who have access to an ATIS[2] account[3]. It takes one or more files as argument and prints them remotely on a defined printer in the ATIS.

## Usage

The order of parameters is completely irrelevant.

    .../ATIS_print [file(s)]* [-u user] [-p printer] [-n number-of-copies] [-r from to] [-c num]

- **files:** Regular expressions and single files are allowed.
- **-u user:** Specify a user for printing. This will dominate the default, but not override it permanently. Like a one-time-ticket. Useful for quickly printing things for others.
- **-p printer:** Use given printer. Must be sw1, sw2, sw3 (monochrome) or farb1 (color).
- **-n number-of-copies:** Specify how many times the files should be printed. Use integers only.
- **-r from to:** Specify a page **r**ange using integers as `from` and `to`. Only pages within this range will be printed if this is used. Otherwise the whole file will be printed. Note that this currently points at the page range, not the document range.
- **-c num:** Compact / N-up print. This will print num pages on one page. `num` can be 2,4,6 or 9. This has to be used carefully when `-r` is also used.

## Dependencies

It depends on basic applications which are default on most unix-like operating systems. Tested on Ubuntu Linux and OSX Mavericks. 

    bash, scp, ssh

## Contribution wishlist, ideas and bugs

- BUG: Files with same names in different directories in one atis\_print call cause problems.
- Bug: -c influences -r in a bad way (see usage). This should be fixed at least for PDFs.
- Allow to print more pages on one paper (like `-#p 4`, see `man lp`). Note that this has impact on the -r option, see [CUPS docs][pageranges]
- For text/code print jobs, allow to adjust the text size (like `--txt-size 8`)
- Allow to print one/two-sided (like `-nd` or `--no-duplex`, also long- or short-sided?)
- Create Install/setup scripts for easier usage (install i.e. to `~/bin/`)
- Create completion file for better terminal experience (bash, fish, ...) or/and a manpage
- User should only need to input the password one time
