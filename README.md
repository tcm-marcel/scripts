This is a collection of (more or less) usefull small scripts I made. Fell free to use/exten/ignore. 


* **Ubuntu Travis Indicator** `./travis_indicator`
  Keeps track of Travis CI builds by sending notifications on status changes, showing recent builds in the menu and indicating the status of the last own build with the icon color. 

* **ATIS print** `./atis_print`
  Script for printing PDF files on one of the ATIS printers of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)

* **VCDdump** `./vcd_dump`
  Python script for the Raspberry Pi dumping the Activity of GPIO pins to a VCD file that can be read by e.g. GTKWave. 

* **IMAP attachment fetcher** `./fetch_image`
  Python script for fetching emails from an IMAP inbox and saving the attachments in directories.
